# Spring Boot Microservices Architecture

## Microservices Architecture Overview
Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to handle a specific business functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This architecture enables building highly maintainable and scalable applications while allowing teams to use different technologies and work in parallel.

### Key Features of Microservices Architecture:
1. **Independent Deployability**:
   - Each service can be deployed independently without affecting other services.
   
2. **Domain-Driven Design**:
   - Services are aligned with business domains, making the application modular and easier to understand.

3. **Technology Diversity**:
   - Teams can use different programming languages, frameworks, and databases for each service as needed.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific performance requirements.

5. **Fault Isolation**:
   - Failures in one service do not propagate to the entire application, ensuring better fault tolerance.

6. **Decentralized Data Management**:
   - Each service manages its own database, eliminating the need for a single, monolithic database.

### Benefits of Microservices:
- Improved agility and speed of development.
- Better scalability to handle growing user demands.
- Enhanced fault isolation to minimize system downtime.
- Easier adoption of new technologies for individual services.

## Project Features
1. **Service-Oriented Design**: Each microservice is dedicated to a specific functionality.
2. **Spring Boot Integration**: Simplifies service creation with built-in tools and configurations.
3. **Communication Between Services**: Implemented using REST APIs.
4. **Independent Data Handling**: Each microservice manages its own database schema.
